# Resume Template

Hello there, I wrote an extensible, print friendly and somewhat responsive resume for myself so that I can customize it to my liking later on. The plan is to use this throughout my career.

The code is far from nice, but it does the job.
Feel free to gain inspiration or use this template as your own.
