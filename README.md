Current styling and setup used for my resume.

The pdf conversion is done using chromium's built-in printer (`Ctrl` + `P` when on page)

### Design rules

Rules / constraints made for myself in order to keep the resume simple and print friendly

* keep it flat (no images, no gradients)
* everything must fit into an A4 paper size
* don't use too many colors or font sizes
* prefer truncating text over condensing text
* high contrast
* limit background graphics

## Future

* Make proper UI and more styles to use.
