 ### Design rules
 
 Rules made for myself in order to keep the resume simple and print friendly
 
 * keep it flat (no images, no gradients)
 * everything must fit into an A4 paper size
 * don't use too many colors or font sizes
 * prefer truncating text over condensing text
 * high contrast
 * limit background graphics

## `__future__`

 * Make proper UI and more styles to use.
