# Resume Template

Hello there, I wrote an extensible, print friendly and somewhat responsive resume for myself so that I can customize it to my liking. The plan is to use this throughout my career.

Feel free to gain inspiration or use this template as your own, however I recommend writing one for yourself because it's a great learning experience.

I just felt like sharing it, I hope you like it.
