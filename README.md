# resume-template

Current styling and setup used for my resume. The idea is to dynamically generate the resume pdf with various themes using React, but it's much more efficient to export it from a Figma sketch. For that reasons the *project is put to a halt.*

[Current figma file for my latest design.](https://www.figma.com/file/oKNCZ67CngL4Zzfa53rZJV/resume?type=design&node-id=9%3A1014&mode=design&t=v4vFB6wD5LKwMLKN-1)

## Theme
 ### Typeface
 The all wonderful [Fraunces](https://fraunces.undercase.xyz/)
 ### Colors
 
| **color name** | **hex value** |
| -------------- | ------------- |
| black          | `#000000`     |
| white          | `#ffffff`     |
| forest-green   | `#439345`     |
| dim            | `#dfdfdf`     |
| paragraph      | `#333333`     |
 
 ### Design rules
 
 Rules made for myself in order to keep the resume simple and print friendly
 
 * keep it flat (no images, no gradients)
 * everything must fit into an A4 paper size
 * don't use too many colors or font sizes
 * prefer truncating text over condensing text
 * high contrast
 * limit background colors

## `__future__`

 * Make proper UI and more styles to use.
